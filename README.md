# Python Progress Tracker

This repository tracks my learning journey in Python.
Each folder contains small projects that build on each other step by step.

## Structure

- 'project-01-hello-world/' -> first program
- 'project-02-calculator/' -> simple calculator, although I do have plans to further integrate scientific things
- 'project-03-expense-tracker/' -> project with read/writing to CSV, familiarity with lists/dicts, functions and modularity practice (prep for Pandas)

## Goal

By the end, I'll have projects that demonstrate:

- Basics (syntax, loops, functions)
- Data Structures
- Libraries and APIs
- Mini projects
