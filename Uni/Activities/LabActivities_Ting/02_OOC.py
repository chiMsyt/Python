Task 2: The Order of Operations Challenge
Without running the code first, predict the output of the following expressions. Then, write a program to check your answers.
1.  result1 = 5 + 3 * 2  2
2.  result2 = (5 + 3) * 2  2
3.  result3 = 10 % 3 + 5 * 2

'''

result1 = 5 + 3 * 2  # 11
result2 = (5 + 3) * 2  # 16
result3 = 10 % 3 + 5 * 2 # 11

print(f"result1: {result1}, result2: {result2}, result3: {result3}")
